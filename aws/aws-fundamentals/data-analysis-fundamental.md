## Volume - Data Storage

- **Structured**(10%) data is organized and stored in the form of values that are grouped into rows and columns of a table.
- **Semistructured(10%)** data is often stored in a series of key-value pairs that are grouped into elements within a file.
- **Unstructured**(80%) data is not structured in a consistent way. Some data may have structure similar to semi-structured data but others may only contain metadata.
