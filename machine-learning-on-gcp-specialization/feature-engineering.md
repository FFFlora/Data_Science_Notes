### Raw Data to Features

Raw data must be mapped into numerical feature vectors

### Good vs Bad Features

1. related to the objective
2. be known at prediction-time
3. be numeric with meaningful magnitude
4. have enough examples
5. bring human insights to the problem.

Don't do data dredging.

some data could be known immediately, some is not **in real time**. **timely manner is important.**

NN are weighing and adding machines, so data better have some numeric meaning.

have at least 5 examples.( way to see if have enough examples: histogram)
