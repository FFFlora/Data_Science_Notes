# Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in Healthcare

Intelligent Automation AI RPA

In next 5-10 years, patients might interact direct with intelligent assistant.

The automation journey begins with fixed process automation and grows all the way to an Intelligent Enterprise.

A lot of these individual components are probably what we are doing today, but what we want to do is combine all of these different components to a front-end application, where a lot of conversation are going behind the scenes.

#### RPA: robotic process automation

There is a section of things that people are doing, and a section of things that robots are doing inside an organization, but from an **intelligent automation**'s perspective, is the **merging of people and technology**'s job: **Software Robots**.

There three general types of RPA, as above shown. The fact is the varies forms of process automation approaches are vastly different; they serve different functions in an organization.

**Recorded Desktop Automation**: simple. not require IT knowledge, run simple scrips, easy to implement. But when scale becomes necessary, or the process becomes a bit complicated, then this type of RPA couldn't handle anymore.

**SDK/IT Developed** controlled under IT department. They obtain requirements from the buz side. IT here must see the business need and speak the business language.

**Digital Workforce Platform/RPA**  it changes management. It has the rules as IT has, the security, permission, policy,etc., but it is the business controls the process.

Any process can be automated processed, but not all the process should be automated processed. 

This types of process that RPA delivers not only  speed and accuracy, but true RPA, takes massive costs and risks out of business. 



##### Healthcare Intelligent Automation Use Cases

All of these procedures from left to right on the back end, including treatment, discharge planning and beyond. For providers it uses as an administrative function and claims and billing have been in initial places really driven some success from the use of RPA, weather it is supply chain process or claim fetching, claims submission and claim checks and etc.

#### Demos in RPA

##### case 1

Preauthorization with commercial insurance payers:

particularly for high dollar imaging, with commercial insurance payers. 

web portal, enter patient's info, enter the tests, provide diagnose code, to get an initial medical from the access of the determination, and pre authorization. It could take from hours to just some seconds. 

Medicaid Secondary Billing:

Automate this process could waive the waiting time from the insurance company, and be the cost saver.

##### Case 2:

Patient's preference, personalize  â˜…

use models to have a 360 view of the patients, store in CRM 

how to provide education training, followups based on the patient's information, reduce unnecessary hospital readmission.

##### case 3

predicting readmission. 

use deep learning and really deep data mining to identify characteristic that are common cross individual thru readmitted. With that, users could put together a complex predictive model, that would allow us to identify patients who are in the risk of readmission in the early process.

Implementing RPA should be similar to any large-scale transformational project.

It's important to understand what is the potential automation potential, or opportunity inside the organization. How does it look like in the business sense? How to remove headcount? How to reducing time to value on the process you taking? Based on all of these, you want to think about what is the automation journey based on these higher level set of activities you want to get after. 

Always to start small and simple and go back to the four-phase cycle again and again. Don't start with the most complex case, say, deep learning.

- if the process is inefficient and broken, if you do automation on it, it still going to be inefficient and broken. So be smart.

- how to use digital workers

- when have the digital workforce, they need to be care for and thought about for.

RPA frees up people.

the risk is accuracy and the huge costs out of the business.

so far as Blue Prism solution is concerned, RPA is now doing things faster and cheaper. 

driving value and differentiation ultimately will help patient have a better healthcare experience.



Tools and software that RPA integrate with?
