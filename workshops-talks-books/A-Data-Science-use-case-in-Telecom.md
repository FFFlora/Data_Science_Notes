  - Wrapper based methods:
    - Random Forest, boosting tree: also good hints for feature engineering
  - Filter methods:
    - missing value ratio
    - low variance filter (less informative features)
    - high correlation filter (similar features) (very tricky)
      - Can be good candidates for interactions: Age vs Income (could do feature crossing)
- Feature Engineering
- Train/Validation/Test
