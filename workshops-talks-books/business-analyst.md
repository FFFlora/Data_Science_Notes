## Business Analytics Interview Question

1. ##### What is analytics?

   Analytics is the scientific process of transforming data into insights for better decisions. It helps recognize patterns, insights, trends within data and thus help organizations make more informed decisions. Organizations now are sitting on a huge amount of data. 

2. ##### How is analytics used within ecommerce and marketing?

   Ecommerce sites utilize analytics heavily to make day-to-day decisions. Analytics evaluates visitor's data in order to make recommendations and suggest products that might interest costumers. This allows for a great cross-sell opportunity: recommendation system. Also, using the information gleaned from specialized analytics, ads being displayed on various sites and search engines can be customized to appeal to specific visitors. Websites rely heavily on visitor's browsing patterns to come up with site design that could more effectively entice visitors to remain on site. 

   Also, every time a customer performs a transaction, makes a retail purchase, visit a website, clicks a link/ads, a data point is created. 
   
   Analytics has helped retailers make real-time personalization possible. Retailers now track the behavior of individual customers and are able to predict when a customer is likely to make the next purchase.
   
3. ##### Why it is important to have an understanding of business?

   In addition to a knowledge of statistics and technologies, a data scientist requires to have the ability to translate the data into business outcomes.

   It's important for analysts to understand the state of the business that they are working in and what trends are affecting it. Also, the understanding of key business processes inside the organization is required, as well as how the decisions are make within them. An analyst should focus on how analytically solving a decision-making problem will influence the business.  Most of the time, analytics requires selling the advanced models inside an organization to various stakeholders. Unless there is a clear proposition on how well analytics is solving the business problem, it will be difficult for management to buy the results. 

   **It is important for an analyst to have a domain specialist mindset. Analytical capabilities are about diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics, and information capabilities are about describing, organizing, and integrating data inside the organization.**

   Always ask the following questions:

   1. How do you leverage data for decision making?
   2. How do you leverage data for analytics?
   3. How do you leverage analytics for decision making?
