### New worksheet:

Dimensions: categorical data

measures: numerical data

### Some Graphs:

- #### Donut Chart 

  Rows: `numbers of records`  x2, set them to minimum or maximum 

  make them `pie` charts, and add  features in the first pie

  make the second `pie` white, make it small, and click the axis -> dual 

- #### Clustering

  Add features to columns and rows, 

  Analysis -> uncheck aggregate -> adjust position 

  Analytics -> cluster -> choose how many clusters 

  Add features to `pages` to add animation 

- #### Time Series

  Add features to col and rows,

  Say, add some feature to colors, 

  Analysis -> Forecast

  Analysis -> add trend line

- #### Geo Map

  Country, State add to the graph, 

  Add some features to the graph 

  Show me -> second geo map (to cover all the map)

  If want to add filter to the map, add the feature to the **filters**, -> drop down list ->  show filter 

- #### Bubble Chart

- #### WordCloud





### Dashboard

**Who's the Audience?**  what kind of data do they want? 

Usually made of **three or less than three** sheets.

Colors should be simple, not too much color.

Add connections between the sheets in the dashboard: （实现交互）

- Dashboard -> Actions -> Add actions -> filter -> select -> ok
